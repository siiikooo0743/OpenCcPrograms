	This program is designed to automate the Botania Runic Altar.
	It requires the StringApiExtend to be loaded(already os.loadAPI()).
	
	In World setup:
	
	A Runic Altar with an AirBlock above it and an Open Crate above that, a hopper facing into the Open Crate,
	a chest for all Items below and a turtle facing the altar below that.
	Additionaly a BC Gate set to Space for Mana and redstone-signale facing the altar and a redstone wire of kinds connecting it to the left of the turtle. 
	The turtle needs to have a wand of the forest.
	
	OC Ho
	Ai Ch -> that is looking at it from the side without the gatee
	RA Tu 
	
	Recipes go in the recipes folder and have the name of the item as their name.
	Their content contains the recipe.
	The file name is: The id, a ":" and the damageValue.
	Due to restrictions in computercraft every ":" needs to be replaced with "_", that includes any that may occur in the id.
	Each item is: The id, a ":", the damageValue, a "%", and the amount.
	The different Items seperated by ";".
	
	Example:
	
	"recipes/Botania_rune_8":
	"manaResource:0%5;manaResource:1%1;
